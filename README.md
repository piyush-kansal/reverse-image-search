Similar Image Search
--------------------

Idea

	Given an image and tags(corresponding to image), find similar images in the dataset. This idea is similar to 
	TinEye.com and Google's "Similar images" feature. However, we also include text based search in it.

	This was done as a part of course project for Words and Pictures(CSE595).
